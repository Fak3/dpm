Download a data package into a directory (named after the data package
"name" property) exactly reproducing the directory structure present
at the publication time (i.e. including any files or folder not listed
as resources (e.g., scripts/ ...)).

The datapackage.json file is the exact same one as the one published
(i.e. without any normalization).

Dependencies specified as "dataDependencies" of the datapackage.json
file are not cloned.

Data Packages are frequently identified by a Data Package Ident(ifier) String.

An Identifier String is a single string identifying a Data Package (and,
implicitly, its location). Examples:

* A direct URL to a datapackage (with or without the `datapackage.json`) e.g.

       http://mywebsite.com/mydatapackage/
       // or with the datapackage.json
       http://mywebsite.com/mydatapackage/datapackage.json

* A Github URL

       http://github.com/datasets/gold-prices

* A single name

       gold-prices

   In this case the data package must be in the core datasets in the primary registry.

Push the Data Package in the current directory into CKAN.

This will also import data from the Data Package resources into the DataStore
(if of appropriate format i.e. CSVs).

If you need to set the owner organization in CKAN use --owner_org e.g.

    dpm ckan http://datahub.io --owner_org=my-organization
